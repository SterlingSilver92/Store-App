# Store App
Store App is for Minecraft servers, to allow them to accept donations and sell things to help with the costs of owning/operating a Minecraft server. It is designed to have enough features to be very useful and flexible but also is made with simplicity in mind. Store App is also designed with the server's finances in mind, we have very clear, very simple, very affordable pricing that is a one time purchase and there are absolutely NO recurring fees, that's the point! We hope you enjoy Store App and we hope it can help lower the costs of owning and operating your Minecraft server!

## Basically...
Basically, Store App lets you sell something on your website and then run a command in game to give the player what they bought. That's it!
